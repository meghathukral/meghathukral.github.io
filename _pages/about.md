Hey! I am a 3rd-year ML PhD student at School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology.
I work at the intersection of machine learning, ubiquitous sensing, and digital health. My research focuses on developing generalizable models for movement and physiological signals from wearable sensors using large-scale unlabeled data (via self-supervised and cross-modal transfer). I also explore how foundation models from data-rich domains, such as language, can be leveraged to improve the modeling of sensing data in low-resource applications.
I am thankful to by OptumAI and <a href='https://www.ai-caring.org'>  NSF AI Caring project </a> for funding my research.
I am grateful to be advised by <a href='https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thomas-ploetz'>  Prof. Thomas Ploetz. </a>
