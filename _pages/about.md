Hey! I am a 2nd-year ML PhD student at School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology.
My current research is focused on developing generalizable machine learning models for sensor-based Human Activity Recognition.  I work with different sensor modalities including but not limited to wearables , smart home ambient sensors, and a combination of both. 
I am currently funded by <a href='https://www.ai-caring.org'>  NSF AI Caring project </a>, focussing on HAR models tragetted for elderly care.
I am grateful to be advised by <a href='https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thomas-ploetz'>  Prof. Thomas Ploetz. </a>
